A personal version of the famous [myFlightRadar24](https://my.flightradar24.com/jofelipe) made with NextJS and GraphQL (with GraphCMS). The application is designed to be displayed in a 10" LCD display (it's not responsive ðŸ™ƒ). There is also a hook to redirect to random pages every 15 seconds, making the application appear as a slideshow .
